# Nat Builder

## Synopsis

Nat builder will works as a bridge between the workflow manager and the corresponding adapter, it will receive a bunch of routers to create/delete on a 'nats.create' and it will emit messages 'nat.create' to process them.

Once all of them are fully processed it will emit back a message 'nats.create.done' as confirmation or 'nats.create.error' in case something is broken
